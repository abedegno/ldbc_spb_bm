Each file in this folder will be executed automatically by the benchmark test driver after the loadCreativeWorks phase has completed.
Scripts will be executed sequentially in alphabetical order and will not have start arguments provided, therefore it is responsibility 
of the script implementor to provide proper initialization by parsing the test.properties file for example.
