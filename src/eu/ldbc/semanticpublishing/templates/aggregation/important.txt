Important note: before compiling with build.xml, make sure that all modified or new java files are first updated in their corresponding .zip archive,
                otherwise the build process will extract (basic.zip or advanced.zip) and will override your changes!!!
                Also make sure that corresponding custom extensions (if any : .standard, .graphdb or .virtuoso) have been modified for each corresponding driver
                version : standard, graphdb or virtuoso
